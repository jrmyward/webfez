        %h3.text-danger.pb-2 The Shriners Invite You to Join!
        %p
          To qualify, you must be a Master Mason in good standing and hold a current blue lodge
          dues card. It is no longer a requirement that you be a 32nd Degree Scottish Rite or York
          Rite Mason before becoming a Shriner (however, we strongly encourage you to join one or
          both of the rites).
        %p
          If you are not a Freemason, you must pursue that first. The
          #{link_to('Grand Lodge of Oregon', 'https://www.masonic-oregon.com/how-to-become-a-mason/')}
          and #{link_to('BeAShrinerNow.com', 'https://www.beashrinernow.com/About/Freemasons/BecomeAMason')}
          have resources on their websites to help you on this journey. Once you are a Master Mason
          you will then be eligible to petition to become a Shriner.

          However, we want you to participate now. Once we receive your application, we will be
          contacting you to provide information on our many units and clubs. You and your lady will
          be invited to our next social event.
        %p.text-muted.small
          * This event is usually held at the Shriners center in Wilsonville. It does not require
          any memory work on your part. The ceremonial gives you (and your lady) the opportunity to
          tour the Portland Shriners Hospital and witness the beautiful ritualistic section and
          ceremonies. You will then undergo a Fezzing Ceremony and become a Noble of Ancient Arabic
          Order Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. No hazing is allowed in any of our ceremonies.
